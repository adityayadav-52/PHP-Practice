Introduction to Oops(Object Oriented Programming Structure) :-
****************************************

In earlier days, in order to write the bigest logic we used two Approachs to write the code :-
1. mono-lithic : when we write the code in single script itself.
2. poly-lithic : when we write the entire code as a group of small script, then it called as polylithic approach.
	1. using functional approach
	2. using Object Oriented approach
	3. using modular approach
	4. and other approach
	These all approaches for writting the code, is called as progarmming paradigm or methodologies or descipline or
	technique, programming mechanism.
	
What is Object Oriented programming system ?
1. It is a programming paradigm or mechanism for developing software highly scalable application.

Object Oriented programming Language :-
Any programming Language which can provide oops support, with all features implemented by OOps that langauge is
called as OOPL(Object Oriented programming Language).

Eg :- C++, Java, C#, PHP, Python etc...

Pillars of Object Oriented programming Language :-
**********************************************
1. Encapsulation
2. Data Hiding
3. Data Abstraction
4. Abstraction
5. Inheritence
6. Has-Relationship
7. is-Relationship
8. Class and Object
9. Polymorphism
10. Dependency Programming
11. Exception Handling


After Object Oriented programming system has left its scope : it leaves some elements as a scrap. The elements are
then re-used and converted into re-usable components are there re-usable components of oops are called as design
pattern.
There are total 23 design patterns( re-usable components ):-
Design Patterns :-
	Structural Pattern :
		1. Decoder
		2. Bridge
		3. Adapter
		4. Flyweight
		5. Facade
		6. Composite
		7. Proxy
		
	Behavioural Pattern :
		8. ChainOfResponsiblity
		9. Observer
		10. Command
		11. State
		12. Strategy
		13. Meiator
		14. Interpreter
		15. Iterator
		16. Template Method
		17. Momento
		18. Visitor
		
	Creational Pattern
		19. Builder
		20. Prototype
		21. Abstract Factory
		22. Factory Method
		23. Singleton
		
		
These are written by four writers and called as Gang-Of-Four(Gang-of-4)


Advantages of oops :-
**************************
1. Easy to Understand
2. Bottom to Top Approach
3. Security
4. Reusability
5. Scope and Memory Management
6. Standardization


1. Is PHP a Object Oriented Language? // Yes in overview --- No in Detail
2. Is JAV a Object Oriented Language? // Yes in overview --- No in Detail
3. Is C#(.net) a Object Oriented Language? // Yes in overview --- No in Detail
4. Is PYTHON a Object Oriented Language? // Yes in overview --- No in Detail
5. Is C++ a Object Oriented Language? // Yes in overview --- No in Detail
6. Is smalltalk a Object Oriented Language? // Yes in overview --- Yes in Detail

Any programming langauge is set to be fully oops based if it does not primtive data type. and If it has then it 
should does not basis of Class and Object.
