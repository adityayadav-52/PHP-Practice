File Uploading:-
    file uploading does not mean the uploading of the medias to, database.
    It is because the database like mysql, oracle are capable of uploading the data in form of text formate.
    Even though if you want to upload the data (other than text such that) it has sum media related mime type then we go for, large text datatype, or BLOB object.

    Note you can upload the image to the database where large amount of data is a constraint like mongodb, S3 ( simple storage service ) bucket (AWS).


In order to upload the data in a server using PHP :-
1. Make sure your php allowes file uploading feature 
    php.ini chech allow_file_uploading : on
    While uploading data, youa can upload max to max 20 files at once and each file size can be 8MB post data.
    But if you want to increase this limit by going to php.ini and modifying the setting.

How to check php.ini information :-
***********************************
1. phpinfo() : it holds the everything about PHP(configuration, settings, versions etc....), (via coding).
2. php.ini manually

How browser will upload file to the server.
1. In order to upload the file :-
    method : POST
    form : enctype : multipart/form-data
    input type : file

    file : save_file_path = 'C:/laragon/tmp'

    How to change this default path.
    goto php.ini
    upload_tmp_dir = 'C:/laragon/tmp'
        if it is empty it will use system  temp (%temp%)
        C:\Users\adity\AppData\Local\Temp


browser -----> http request ----> (formdata) ----> server (tmp folder)

Follow three steps for file uploading :-

1. $_FILES : 2D array
            1. name : name of the file
            2. size : file size
            3. error : any error occured during uploading not related to file
            4. type : file type
            5. tmp_name : tmp location where file is uploaded.

2. use function move_uploaded_file($tmplocation,$newlocation);
where file is finally uploaded.

3. Send the uploaded file name to the db.



Task :-
gallery :
    id file
    1. 1.png

uploads :
    1.png

    $filenames = select('file')->table('gallery')->allRecords();

    forEach($filenames as $images){
        echo "<img src='uploads/{$images["file"]}'>";
    }
